## Purpose

This document outlines theoretical resonant chamber structures used to support harmonic field balance simulations within IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe.

These structures are **mathematical constructs only**. No physical hardware is implied or described.

## 1. Structural Geometry Overview

- **Chamber Shape:**  
  - Tri-spiral toroidal hybrid  
  - Internal Gankyil-based rotational symmetry  
  - Outer Tesla-style harmonic layer envelope

- **Primary Materials (Theoretical):**  
  - High-resistance ceramics  
  - Plasma-insulating composite polymers

## 2. Resonance Control Parameters

| Parameter             | Value Range                    | Notes                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Internal Volume      | 10–500 liters (simulation)     | Concept only                   |
| Wall Harmonic Layers | 3 active pulse zones           | Tesla 3-6-9 frequency control |
| Gankyil Rotation Speed | 0.5–5 Hz equivalent            | Non-mechanical simulated value |

## 3. Harmonic Layer Composition

- **Layer 1:** Tesla Primary (120 Hz)  
- **Layer 2:** Tesla Secondary (15 Hz)  
- **Layer 3:** Tesla Tertiary (0.5 Hz)  

All layers integrated into theoretical chamber wall envelope using simulated harmonic field mapping.

## 4. Civilian Limitation Clause

- No plasma containment systems are described or implied.  
- No actual fusion energy systems are represented.  
- This document remains strictly within **civilian scientific education scope**.
