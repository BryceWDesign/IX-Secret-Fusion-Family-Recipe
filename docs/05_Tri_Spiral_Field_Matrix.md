# Tri-Spiral Field Matrix Design  
## IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe

---

## Purpose

The Tri-Spiral Field Matrix (TSFM) is the core structural and energetic balancing mechanism within IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe.

It provides **rotational plasma containment** and **field resonance modulation** using civilian-accessible coil and lattice systems.

## Design Principles

- **Tri-Spiral Layout:**  
  Three primary coil arms arranged in 120-degree separation around central plasma volume.

- **Field Matrix Layers:**  
  1. Primary Harmonic Layer — Tesla 3-6-9 tuned frequency lattice.  
  2. Secondary Balance Layer — Gankyil rotational spiral configuration.  
  3. Tertiary Stabilization Layer — Slow phase modulation to maintain plasma symmetry.

- **Non-Magnetic Structural Components:**  
  Required to avoid harmonic field interference. Includes carbon composites and ceramic shielding.

## Mathematical Basis

- **Tri-Spiral Formula:**  
  Each coil arm follows a logarithmic spiral function: r(θ) = a * e^(bθ)

Where:
- `a` = Initial radius constant  
- `b` = Growth rate factor  
- `θ` = Spiral angle in radians

- **Rotational Balancing Condition:**  
Total field vector sum across all three spirals equals zero when in harmonic equilibrium: Σ F_spiral = 0

## Civilian Design Limits

- No active plasma ignition systems.  
- No direct fusion ignition components.  
- Open-source theoretical architecture only.

## Summary

TSFM represents the fusion of geometric field science and theoretical fusion principles into a structured civilian-accessible system.

Its purpose is to **model rotational plasma containment** through harmonic, tri-spiral configurations, while maintaining open-source compliance.
