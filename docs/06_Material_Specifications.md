## 1. Core Containment Shell Materials

- **Primary Material:**  
  - Tungsten Carbide Alloy (non-magnetic)  
  - Operating Temperature Range: up to 3800°C  
  - High radiation resistance  

- **Secondary Layer:**  
  - Carbon Fiber Reinforced Ceramic Composites  
  - Structural flexibility and thermal expansion tolerance  

- **Outer Layer:**  
  - High-purity Silica Aerogel Panels  
  - Thermal insulation and plasma field damping

## 2. Coil and Field Lattice Materials

- **Primary Harmonic Coils:**  
  - Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity (OFHC) Copper with Graphene Reinforcement  
  - Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic tuning structures  

- **Secondary Balance Coils:**  
  - Non-magnetic Superalloy Wires (e.g., Inconel variants)  
  - Tolerance to high harmonic field stresses

## 3. Non-Magnetic Structural Supports

- **Materials:**  
  - Silicon Carbide Reinforced Polymers  
  - Boron Nitride Ceramic Panels  
  - Carbon-Carbon Composite Trusses

## 4. Material Notes

- All materials listed are **civilian-available** and **non-restricted** under international export control lists.  
- No use of controlled fusion reactor alloys (e.g., ITER-class specialized beryllium or lithium breeder materials).  
- Focus on harmonic field stability and thermal containment only.
