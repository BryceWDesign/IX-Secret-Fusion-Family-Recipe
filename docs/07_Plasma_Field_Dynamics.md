# Plasma Field Dynamics  
## IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe

---

## Purpose

This document defines key plasma field behaviors, control mechanisms, and stability parameters modeled within the IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe theoretical framework.

All descriptions apply strictly to **non-ignition, civilian-use conceptual systems**.

---

## 1. Rotational Balance Requirement

- **Objective:** Maintain tri-spiral plasma rotation symmetry.  
- **Metric:** Net field vector sum must approach zero:  
  `Σ F_spiral ≈ 0`  
- **Control Inputs:** Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic field injection + Gankyil rotational phase timing.

---

## 2. Harmonic Field Injection

- **Primary Frequency Layer:** 60–360 Hz Tesla-based modulating pulses.  
- **Secondary Balance Layer:** 3–30 Hz Gankyil balance pulses.  
- **Tertiary Stabilization Layer:** 0.1–1.0 Hz plasma phase correction pulses.

---

## 3. Plasma Density Zones

- **Core Convergence Zone:**  
  Triple-alpha process modeling area.  
  - Density: 10^19–10^22 particles/m³ (theoretical range).

- **Outer Field Layer:**  
  Surrounding tri-spiral matrix containment shell.  
  - Density: <10^15 particles/m³ (non-fusion plasma state).

---

## 4. Thermal Considerations

- **Target Core Temperatures:**  
  80–120 MK (Mega Kelvin), purely simulated via non-linear harmonic modeling.  
- **Structural Temperature Limits:**  
  Containment shell limited to 2500–3800°C maximum operational rating based on tungsten carbide and carbon composite materials.

## 5. Civilian Limitation Clause

- **No real plasma ignition protocols included.**  
- **No restricted fusion ignition technologies described.**  
- **Open-source educational and scientific modeling purpose only.**

## Summary

IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe defines plasma field dynamics through **rotational symmetry, harmonic field layering, and structured density zoning**—remaining compliant with civilian open-source standards.
