## 2. Software Architecture

- **Core Language:** Python 3.x
- **Primary Libraries:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Custom IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe Modules

- **Control Loop Frequency:**  
  - Adjustable from 0.1 Hz to 360 Hz depending on harmonic layer control requirements.

---

## 3. Hardware Recommendations

- **Processing Unit:**  
  - ARM Cortex or x86_64 architecture  
  - 1.5 GHz or higher CPU clock  
  - Minimum 8 GB RAM

- **I/O Interfaces:**  
  - High-speed DAC/ADC modules for signal injection and sensor feedback (simulated).

- **Power Supply:**  
  - Standard civilian AC power source  
  - No nuclear-grade or restricted hardware

---

## 4. Civilian Limitation Clause

- This architecture is **purely theoretical** and for **educational open-source purposes only**.  
- It does not control real plasma fusion ignition systems or classified containment technologies.
