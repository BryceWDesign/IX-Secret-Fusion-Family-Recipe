# Energy Phase Mapping  
## IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe

---

### Purpose

This document outlines how energy phases are mapped, tuned, and monitored in the IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe theoretical framework.

It defines plasma field states, harmonic input phases, and tri-spiral balance conditions for civilian-use theoretical modeling.

## 1. Phase Layering Concept

- **Primary Phase:**  
  Tesla 3-6-9 base harmonic pulse frequency input.  
  Range: 60–360 Hz equivalent field tuning.

- **Secondary Phase:**  
  Rotational Gankyil balance phase modulator.  
  Range: 3–30 Hz rotational harmonic input.

- **Tertiary Phase:**  
  Tri-alpha plasma containment energy convergence phase.  
  Range: 0.1–1.0 Hz equivalent (slow modulating stabilizer waveforms).

## 2. Energy Map Layers

**Layer 1:**  
- Core plasma tri-nuclear convergence zone.  
- Controlled by tertiary phase balance inputs.

**Layer 2:**  
- Resonance modulation grid (Tesla lattice).  
- Controlled by primary and secondary phase synchronization.

**Layer 3:**  
- Structural containment field.  
- Passive, non-powered, reliant on composite geometry and material properties.

## 3. Civilian-Use Only Note

This energy phase mapping structure is a **non-restricted civilian scientific modeling framework**.

- No direct nuclear ignition logic.  
- No restricted plasma confinement blueprints.  
- Open-source conceptual harmonic energy system.

## Summary

IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe phase mapping blends **non-linear resonance, rotational balancing, and triple-alpha core logic** into a multi-phase layered model.

It is strictly theoretical, intended for open-source civilian science research.
