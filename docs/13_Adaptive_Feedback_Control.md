## Purpose

This document details the theoretical adaptive feedback control methods used in IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe to maintain harmonic balance and Gankyil rotational stability during triple-alpha modeling simulations.

---

## 1. Feedback System Overview

- **Primary Function:**  
  Continuously adjust Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic parameters based on phase balance error detection.

- **Feedback Source:**  
  Plasma field simulation outputs measured against harmonic control signals.

## 2. Core Feedback Loop Parameters

| Parameter              | Value Range                      | Notes                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Phase Error Tolerance | ±0.5%                            | Civilian-educational range  |
| Adjustment Rate       | 0.001–0.005 phase shift units/s | Simulated non-hardware rate |

## 3. Gankyil Phase Correction Logic

- **Phase Offset Tracking:**  
  - Monitor rotational phase drift per Gankyil arm.  
  - Adjust Tesla harmonic layer parameters accordingly.

- **Correction Application:**  
  - Update harmonic phase shift.  
  - Update rotational correction factor.

## 4. Adaptive Feedback Algorithm Structure

```plaintext
1. Initialize baseline Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic parameters.
2. Simulate plasma field profile.
3. Calculate phase balance error.
4. Apply corrective adjustment:
    - Harmonic phase shift.
    - Gankyil rotational offset.
5. Repeat simulation cycle.


## 5. Civilian Limitation Clause
No real-world hardware control is implied.

No ignition systems or plasma containment hardware are involved.

This process is purely theoretical and for civilian scientific modeling only.

Summary
IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe uses a non-restricted adaptive feedback control structure to maintain harmonic field balance during triple-alpha simulations, leveraging Tesla 3-6-9 structuring and Gankyil phase correction exclusively within civilian educational boundaries.
