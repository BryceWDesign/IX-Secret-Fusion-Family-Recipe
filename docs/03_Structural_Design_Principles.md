### 1. Tri-Nuclear Resonance Containment Shell

- **Geometry:**  
  Tri-spiral coil geometry surrounding a triple-core plasma reaction space.

- **Materials:**  
  High-grade non-magnetic, high-temperature alloys with embedded ceramic composite layers.

- **Purpose:**  
  To simulate triple-alpha fusion containment via harmonic modulation rather than brute-force magnetic confinement.

### 2. Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Field Lattice

- **Structure:**  
  Resonant field generation lattice configured on Tesla's 3-6-9 frequency intervals.

- **Arrangement:**  
  3 Primary coils, 6 secondary modulators, 9 tertiary field tuners.

- **Function:**  
  Stabilize plasma phase states and support tri-spiral rotational balance.

### 3. Gankyil Formation Reactor Core Layout

- **Core Concept:**  
  Three dynamically phased plasma arms in rotational balance around a central carbon-seeding chamber.

- **Balancing Logic:**  
  Gankyil rotational phase timing applied to tri-coil electromagnetic pulse sequencing.

- **Energy Modulation:**  
  Non-linear resonance input pulses regulating plasma density and rotational symmetry.

### 4. Non-Magnetic Support Structures

- **Reasoning:**  
  To avoid magnetic interference with harmonic field systems.

- **Materials:**  
  Advanced ceramic composites, carbon-fiber reinforced polymers, tungsten-carbide structural layers.
