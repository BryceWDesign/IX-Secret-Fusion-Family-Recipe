## Purpose

This document outlines theoretical algorithmic structures used to control harmonic field layering and rotational plasma balance within the IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe framework.

All algorithms are **civilian-use only** and do not model restricted ignition systems.

## 1. Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Layer Control

- **Primary Pulse Generator:**  
  Base Frequency: 120 Hz ±10% adjustable  
  Algorithm: Sinusoidal wave generation, amplitude-modulated using non-linear envelope functions.

- **Secondary Balance Controller:**  
  Frequency: 15 Hz ±5%  
  Algorithm: Phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization with primary layer.

- **Tertiary Stabilization Layer:**  
  Frequency: 0.5 Hz ±0.05 Hz  
  Algorithm: Slow feedback loop with adaptive phase correction.

## 2. Gankyil Rotational Phase Control

- **Rotation Phase Split:**  
  3-way phase offset (0°, 120°, 240° equivalent).  
  Algorithm: Circular buffer managing each phase arm independently.

- **Feedback Mechanism:**  
  Input: Rotational field stability metric from plasma simulator.  
  Output: Micro-adjustments to each harmonic layer’s amplitude and phase timing.

## 3. Algorithm Pseudocode Example

```plaintext
For each time step:
    Calculate primary_harmonic = sin(2π * primary_freq * t) * envelope(t)
    Calculate secondary_harmonic = sin(2π * secondary_freq * t + phase_shift)
    Calculate tertiary_harmonic = sin(2π * tertiary_freq * t + correction)

    Combined_field = (primary_harmonic + secondary_harmonic + tertiary_harmonic) / 3

    Update phase_shift and correction based on feedback

4. Civilian Limitation Clause
Algorithms described herein are for theoretical plasma balance simulation only.

No ignition sequences, no direct fusion energy generation, no restricted technologies involved.

Summary
IX-Secret-Fusion-Family-Recipe harmonic control algorithms integrate Tesla 3-6-9 pulse structuring, Gankyil rotational balancing, and adaptive feedback loops in a civilian-use theoretical framework.
